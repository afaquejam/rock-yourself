A project to reduce the pain of getting (more than one & mostly interesting) stuff from the internet by eliminating the need of URLs as much as possible.  

We intend to develop this and modify according to the needs of users, as fast as possible.

Contributions to this project, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome with arms wide open.

A hopeful project from Afaque Hussain S J.
