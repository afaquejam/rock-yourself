A project to reduce the pain of getting (more than one & mostly interesting) stuff from the internet by eliminating the need of URLs as much as possible.  

The project comes in two variations, the differentiating factor being the interface. We currently support two kinds of interface:

1. CLI - A command line interface, mostly for programmers, maybe.
2. GUI - A Graphical User Interface for the rest.

We intend to develop this and modify according to the needs of users, as fast as possible.

Contributions to this project, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome with arms wide open.

A hopeful project from Afaque Hussain S J.
