ROCK-YOURSELF CLI - A command line interface for Rock-Yourself.

INSTALLATION:

1. Download the debian package named 'package-rockyourself_1.0_all'. 
2. Install it using the Ubuntu Software Center or by command line using the terminal:
   sudo dpkg -i package-rockyourself_1.0_all.deb 

That's it! It's installed :).

USAGE:

1. Just create a text file containing list of your queries as you search in YouTube. For best results write first, the artist name followed by the audio book name. For example you can create file named 'mylist' having contents:

Robin hood chapter 1 audio book
The hobbit Part 1 audio book 
Sherlock Holmes Complete Audiobook
Mark Twain The adventures of huckleberry Finn Part 1 Audio Book 
And so on ... there is no limit to the enteres :).

2. Make sure you end your file with an empty line.

3. After saving the file, open up the terminal and navigate to the location where you created the file 'mylist'.
4. After navigating to the file's location, just run this command: rockyourself mylist
5  Wait and watch (or get a coffee)! Within minutes your audio books will be there in the folder from where you ran the command.
6. Cheers!

UNINSTALLATION:

There you go, be happy!

Note: This is a software run on a computer! It will provide you correct results given the correct input. Make sure your input is as precise and unambigious as possible. 

Cheers!
Afaque.
