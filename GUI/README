Note: This is a software, it will provide you correct results for correct input. Make sure you input some meaningfull. For example if you just put like bon jovi, then how does the computer know to  which song it has downlaod. Well, it downloads the most popular song of that artist. Don't put something weird like robin hood song. You will be surprised with the results.
